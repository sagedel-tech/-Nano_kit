1. Circuit Assembly:
   - Ensure that the components are connected according to the provided diagram and the breadboard layout matches. Double-check connections for accuracy.

2. Connect Arduino Nano to Computer:
   - Make sure the USB cable securely connects the Arduino Nano to your computer.

3. Open Arduino IDE:
   - Verify that the Arduino IDE is installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the Arduino website.

4. Copy and Paste Code:
   - Copy the code provided in the RFID_UFD file and paste it into the Arduino IDE.
   - Ensure that the code aligns with the circuit connections and setup.

5. Upload Code:
   - Press `Ctrl + U` to upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the Serial Monitor (`Ctrl + Shift + M`) to observe output messages.

6. Read RFID Tag:
   - Bring an RFID card or key near the RFID reader.
   - Note the value displayed in the Serial Monitor.
   - Record this value for future reference.

7. Copy and Paste Security Code:
   - Copy the code from the RFID SENSOR file and paste it into the Arduino IDE.
   - Navigate to line 52 and replace the placeholder values (01, 9C, 0f, 26) with the value obtained from step 6.

8. Upload Modified Code:
   - Press `Ctrl + U` to upload the modified code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to monitor the program's output.

9. Verification:
   - Confirm that the Green LED lights up when the correct RFID tag is presented.
   - Confirm that the Red LED lights up when an incorrect RFID tag is presented.
   - Verify that the servo motor opens and closes based on the RFID tag presented.

10. Troubleshooting:
   - If any issues arise during the procedure, double-check connections, code, and component compatibility.
   - Refer to the manual or seek online resources for troubleshooting guidance.

By following these refined steps, users should be able to effectively set up and run the RFID sensor program with an Arduino Nano, ensuring accuracy and functionality.
