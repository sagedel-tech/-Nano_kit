To run and perform the program using the provided code for the Smart Notice Board with ESP8266 and an LCD display, follow these steps:

1. Setup Hardware:
   - Connect the ESP8266 board (e.g., NodeMCU) to your computer via USB.
   - Connect the I2C LCD display to the ESP8266 board. Make sure to connect the SDA pin to D2 and the SCL pin to D1.

2. Install Libraries:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries...`.
   - Search for and install the following libraries if you haven't already:
     - `ESP8266WiFi`
     - `ESPAsyncTCP`
     - `ESPAsyncWebServer`
     - `Wire`
     - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`

3. Set Wi-Fi Credentials:
   - In the code, replace `"realme X3"` with your Wi-Fi network's SSID and `"12345678"` with the corresponding password.

4. Upload Code:
   - Copy the provided code and paste it into the Arduino IDE.
   - Make sure your ESP8266 board is selected under `Tools` > `Board`.
   - Select the correct port under `Tools` > `Port`.
   - Click the "Upload" button (arrow icon) or press `Ctrl + U` to compile and upload the code to your ESP8266 board.

5. Monitor Serial Output (Optional):
   - Open the Serial Monitor (`Ctrl + Shift + M`) to view debug messages and the IP address assigned to the ESP8266 board. The IP address is crucial for accessing the web server.

6. Access Web Interface:
   - Once the code is uploaded successfully and the ESP8266 is connected to the Wi-Fi network, open a web browser on any device connected to the same network.
   - Enter the IP address of the ESP8266 (displayed in the Serial Monitor) in the browser's address bar and press Enter.

7. Control the Notice Board:
   - In the web interface, you should see a text input field where you can enter the message to be displayed on the LCD.
   - Enter the desired message and click the "Send" button.
   - The message will be displayed on the LCD connected to the ESP8266 board.

8. Observe LCD Output:
   - Check the LCD display to verify that the message entered through the web interface is correctly displayed.

9. Modify and Experiment:
   - Feel free to modify the code according to your requirements. You can change the HTML structure, add more functionality, or adjust the display settings as needed.

10. Troubleshooting:
   - If you encounter any issues, double-check your connections, Wi-Fi credentials, and ensure that the libraries are installed correctly.
   - Refer to the Serial Monitor for any error messages or debugging information to help diagnose the problem.
