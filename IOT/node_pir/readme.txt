To run and perform the program you provided, which detects motion using a PIR sensor and serves a web page indicating whether motion is detected or not, follow these steps:

1. Setup Hardware:
   - Connect your NodeMCU board to your computer via USB.
   - Connect a PIR sensor to pin D1 (or any other digital pin you prefer) on the NodeMCU board.
   - Ensure the PIR sensor has power (usually connected to 5V) and ground (connected to GND) as well.

2. Install Arduino IDE:
   - Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the official Arduino website.

3. Install ESP8266 Board Package:
   - Follow the steps mentioned earlier to add ESP8266 board support to your Arduino IDE.

4. Open Arduino IDE:
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.

5. Install Required Libraries:
   - Ensure that you have the `ESP8266WiFi` and `ESP8266WebServer` libraries installed.
   - If not, you can install them via `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries...` and searching for the libraries by name.

6. Configure WiFi Credentials:
   - Replace the placeholders for `ssid` and `password` with your WiFi network credentials.

7. Upload the Code:
   - Copy the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your NodeMCU board to your computer if it's not already connected.
   - Select the correct board (`NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)`) and port under `Tools` menu.
   - Click the upload button (arrow icon) or press `Ctrl + U` to upload the code to your NodeMCU board.

8. Monitor Serial Output:
   - Open the serial monitor (`Tools` > `Serial Monitor`) to view the debug messages.
   - You should see messages indicating the status of the WiFi connection and the IP address assigned to the NodeMCU.

9. Access the Web Page:
   - Once the NodeMCU is connected to the WiFi network, open a web browser on any device connected to the same network.
   - Enter the IP address assigned to the NodeMCU in the browser's address bar. (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`)
   - You should see a webpage displaying the status of motion detection. If motion is detected by the PIR sensor, it will display "Motion detected: Yes"; otherwise, it will display "Motion detected: No".

10. Test Motion Detection:
    - Move in front of the PIR sensor to trigger motion detection and observe the change in the web page.
